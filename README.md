# README for AI-Driven Financial Risk Assessment Platform

## Overview

The AI-Driven Financial Risk Assessment Platform is a prototype designed to demonstrate the integration of machine learning techniques in financial risk assessment. This platform aims to provide users with the ability to aggregate financial data, analyze risks, predict financial outcomes, and present findings via a user-friendly dashboard.

## Key Components

1. **Automated Data Aggregation**: 
   - Utilizes APIs such as `yfinance` to fetch historical financial data for specified stock tickers. This data aggregation supports real-time analysis by regularly updating the collected financial information.

2. **Risk Profiling**: 
   - Implements machine learning models (like Random Forests) to generate risk profiles from the financial data. This is essential for understanding an individual or business's risk exposure based on historical patterns and trends.

3. **Predictive Analytics**: 
   - Employs predictive models to anticipate future financial scenarios, leveraging patterns in the data to provide foresight into possible financial risks or opportunities.

4. **Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing**:
   - Offers the ability to simulate and analyze the impact of various economic or financial scenarios on the user's portfolio, testing resilience under different stress conditions.

5. **User-Friendly Dashboard**:
   - Uses web-based applications like `Streamlit` to provide an intuitive and interactive interface where users can input data and receive visual analytics feedback.

## Implementation

- The prototype is developed using Python with several key libraries including `pandas` for data manipulation, `numpy` for numerical operations, `scikit-learn` for machine learning, and `streamlit` for creating an interactive dashboard.
- `yfinance` is employed for data extraction related to financial markets, ensuring accessibility to up-to-date market information.
- The system is designed with modular functions that handle distinct tasks such as data fetching, risk calculation, and scenario simulation.

## Running the Platform

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system.
   - Install required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file using Python's package manager: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Execution**:
   - Navigate to the project directory and run the `Streamlit` application by executing: `streamlit run main.py`.
   - Enter the desired stock tickers to begin retrieving and analyzing financial data.

## Future Development

- This prototype serves as a foundation for further enhancements such as integrating natural language processing for analyzing market sentiments or incorporating more sophisticated models for financial forecasting.
- Future developments should also focus on safeguarding data privacy and ensuring compliance with financial regulations for broader industry application.

This README provides a succinct overview of the platform's functionalities and implementation strategy, aimed at providing users with the tools to monitor and manage financial risks efficiently.
